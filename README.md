Title:
Identification of Diabetes in a person based on healthcare statistics.

Project Statement:
Diabetes cases over the past fifteen years have bloomed all over the world. Lifestyle plays a
very important role in it. In recent years, there has been an improvement in awareness regarding the
health effects of diabetes. This has led to people getting themselves tested for diabetes than they
would have earlier, as its risk can be reduced if it is predicted early.

Outcomes:
The goal is to develop a model which helps better understand the relationship between lifestyle
and diabetes and help predict whether a patient has diabetes, is pre-diabetic or healthy.
